1)  The total cost is 56,  the Big O complexity for a push is O(n)  linear complexity
    ammortized this complexity is O(1)+

2) The total cost is 260,  also with a linear big O complexity of O(n)

3)  Pushing items onto the stack until it is over capacity, causing it to grow to double size and copy all items
    after this push a pop would cause it to be at half capacity causing another realocation, and n copies.  from here this
    pattern could repeat causing n copies on each operation.
    
    A possible improvment would be to shrink the arrays capacity to 1/2 when it is 1/4 full,  meaning that a push directcly following a pop
    cant result in two N cost operations in a row.
